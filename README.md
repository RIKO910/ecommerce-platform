# Project Name

Brief description of the project.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

- PHP >= 8.0
- Composer
- Laravel >= 9.x
- MySQL or another database system (if applicable)
- Node.js (for frontend assets)
- NPM or Yarn

## Installation

### 1. Extract the project files:

Unzip the provided archive to your desired directory.

### 2. Install PHP dependencies:

Navigate to the project folder and install the necessary PHP packages using Composer:

```bash
composer install
```

### 3. Install Node dependencies:

If your project includes frontend assets (CSS/JS), install the required Node packages:

```bash
npm install
```

or, if you're using Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

### 4. Database setup:

Since the database has already been provided:

1. Import the database using the SQL file included in the project (e.g., `database.sql`).
    - Use a database tool like **phpMyAdmin**, **MySQL Workbench**, or run the following command in your terminal:
      ```bash
      mysql -u your_username -p your_database < /path/to/database.sql
      ```
2. Ensure that the `.env` file is correctly configured for your local environment. You don't need to modify this unless you're changing the database credentials or other environment-specific settings.

### 5. Compile assets (CSS, JS):

If your project includes frontend assets, compile them using:

For development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

For production:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Running the Application

### 1. Start the local development server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```
